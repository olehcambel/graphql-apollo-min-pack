In that connection, we have made a collaboration with sabona, which is a charity that works to better levevilkårene to children and adults in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe money will be used to build a new vannbrønn in the village dopota in the province Water is grunnpillaren in Maslow's needs, and today, residents go several miles daily to pick up what they need as the most. It makes it difficult to get time enough for example school and education, which is the most important satsningsområdet for sabona and the reason they want to build the well. Every little bit helps, and no donations are too big or too small. The Collection will run throughout our journey, but a gift is just a few keystrokes away, so there's no need to wait.`,

    description: `To raise awareness to the fact that 84% of the population are against fox hunting, myself and the team behind 'Keeptheban' will be cycling 84 miles for the 84% from London to Southampton. We hope to raise funds for Freshfields Animal Rescue. The challenge will be knackering and the aim is to make it down there within 6/7 hours. We will be uploading images and videos of the bike ride onto the 'Keeptheban' Facebook page. Please donate whatever you can afford. Thank you. \n\n"Freshfields Animal Rescue has been caring for abused, abandoned and unwanted animals across Merseyside and North Wales for over 30 years.
